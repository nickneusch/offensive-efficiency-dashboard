(Data is not provided for privacy reasons)

I developed an interactive dashboard for the Duquesne University Basketball coaching staff to analyze their offensive possessions. Analytics are focused on paint touches, post touches, and shooting efficiency on different spots of the court.

## Motivation

My friend, Taylor, owns a sports cards business. Within his business, he submits cards for grading to PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator). Each card is graded on a scale from 1-10, depending on the quality of four main categories: centering, corners, edges, and surface condition. A higher numerical grade indicates a more prestine card. Thus, cards that receive higher grades are worth exponentially more than their raw (ungraded) value, however, cards that receive a low grade can decrease the value of the card. Additionally, there is a ~$20 fee to grade each card. Therefore, it is important to be selective when deciding which cards to submit. I created this dashboard to help Taylor use analytics to help guide his decision-making.

## Workflow
1. Watch the film of each Duquesne Basketball game while collecting various stats (ex. paint touches, post touches, region of the court each shot is taken, points, etc).
2. Ensure data is prepped to be imported into Tableau through a python script
3. Data is imported into Tableau and analyzed with various Tableau "Custom Calculations"
4. Combine multiple tables into the dashboard. Add a filters tab that analyzes the data based on which filters are chosen.
